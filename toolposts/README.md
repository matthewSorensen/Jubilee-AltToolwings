# Big Tool Post, for Big Tools

I had quite a bit of trouble with default toolposts flexing with heavier tool, so I designed
a significantly chonkier version that uses a spline geometry stolen from a brand of lathe
toolposts I like. Smooth adjustability, very strong lock with very little movement during locking,
and all the chonk.


Print all parts at 6 perimeters, 25% infill. Insert two M3 heated insert nuts in the horn. Be sure
to use two M3 washers between bolt heads and the spacer - otherwise, the plastic will creep significantly.
