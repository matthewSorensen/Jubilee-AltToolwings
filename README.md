# Modified Jubilee Parking Wings

Modified tool parking wings for a [Jubilee](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee) 3D-printer/general robot friend. The original
design used a small laser cut delrin flexure, which works very well but requires a 60Wish laser cutter for fabrication. As such
machines aren't universally available, I redesigned the geometry for 3D-printing in a flexible filament.

Print *flexure.stl* in fully-dense PCTPE and either of the wing versions in PLA with the
[default Jubilee printing settings](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=3D_Printed_Parts).Attach the flexure to the wing with 2
8mm long M3 flathead screws (boltdepot pn. 7213).
