# Jubilee Modifications

In the course of building my [Jubilee 3D Printer](https://jubilee3d.com/)/whatever machine, I've made a number of
modifications to better support large, heavy tools, improve long-term dimensional stability, and increase fabricability.

* *hemera-tool* contains a Hemera tool plate modified to include a laser cut aluminum space for creep resistance.

* *toolwings* contains designs for tool mounting wings printed in PCTPE, instead of laser-cut delrin. Somewhat obsolete
  since the introduction of O-ring mounting wings.

* *toolposts* contains a very rigid toolpost for larger tools.
